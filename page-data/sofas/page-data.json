Looks pretty great with a sheepskin throw, if we may say so. With use, this leather will become softer and more wrinkled and the cushions will take on a lived-in look, like your favorite leather jacket.","brand":"Jason Bourne","currentInventory":10,"id":"84d3e0ee-39ca-4861-b146-1bbbc7cda170"},{"categories":["on sale","sofas"],"name":"Sven Tan Matte","price":"1200","image":"../images/products/couch8.png","description":"You don’t have to go outside to be rugged.
