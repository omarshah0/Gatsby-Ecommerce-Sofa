## About the project

### Tailwind

This project is styled using Tailwind. To learn more how this works, check out the Tailwind documentation [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

### How it works

As it is set up, inventory is fetched from a local hard coded array of inventory items. This can easily be configured to instead be fetched from a remote source like Shopify or another CMS or data source by changing the inventory provider.

#### Configuring inventory provider

Update __providers/inventoryProvider.js__ with your own inventory provider.

### Updating with Auth / Admin panel

1. Update __src/pages/admin.js__ with sign up, sign, in, sign out, and confirm sign in methods.

2. Update __src/templates/ViewInventory.js__ with methods to interact with the actual inventory API.

3. Update __src/components/formComponents/AddInventory.js__ with methods to add item to actual inventory API.
